## Situation where you had to escalate to your manager

Start
* Might have crashed a bank website

Basic
* Bank application assessment
* Prduction application
* No testing window provided
* No limitation provided for testing

To manager
* Should not be intrusive
* A testing window should be provided
* Had a call with the application team with PL, CL and Manager on call.
* Discussed the whole scenario and reached to a conclusion that the test will be performed during off hours 
* Intrusive testing should not be performed

Result
* Potentially avoided crashing on a bank application that would have impacted thousands if not millions of users.
* Helped the application team understand the process of standard Pentest, and should be expected.
* Convinced the team to get an intrusive pentest performed on a UAT-env for better coverage

## Tell me about yourself
* Working as a security consultant at Synopsys
* The position is termed as security consultant because we get third party application which are usually a black box for us and not in house application
* There are multiple services that I offer like Web pentest, web service pentest and secure code review.
Process
* Process looks something like
* I get an application URL with test creds and basic information about env
* I start by going over the application
* Understanding the purpose of the application and the major threats factors of the application
* Next burp and app scan is setup for the application
* Once the scan are set-up, next I start the manually assessing the application
* Anti-automation, Authentication, authorization, File uploads, logging, sensitive information, server conf, session mngmnt, business logic
* Once the testing is completed and the scans are also done. The scan findings are triaged
* Finally a report is created with the findings from man testing and scan.
* The report contains description, proper STP, impact and the remediation for the findings.
* The reports are written in such a way so that it's easy to follow for person from non technical background as well.
* Get with application team to explain the finding in details and answer their questions
Found really good Vuln last week:

## Why are you best for the position
* I am the best candidate for this position due to multiple reasons
* First my experience as a developer
    * helps me understand coding languages and the common area where a vuln can be found
    * It also helps me to write programs to automate whatever can be automated
    * It helps in saving time on repeatative tasks
    * For example just setting up a burp scan
        * rather than creating a new project and storing it from UI than selecting the configuration file and than adding the URl to scan
        * I would rather write a script that takes two arg a file path and URL and just click enter
* My experience as a Blockchain engineer
    * Helps me to understand the consequence of a single mistake
    * how important it is to look into all the functionality that the application provides and make sure it can only be used as intended
* My experience at Synopsys
    * Makes me better at locating vulnarabilies and how to exploit them so that the risk associated can be properly assessed
    * It makes me really good at explaining security concepts to application developers who are not famalier with these concepts

Mention ILT
